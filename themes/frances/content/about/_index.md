My name is Ben and I'm an amateur photographer. I primarily work in 35mm film. Currently, I am selling prints in order to raise money for organizations that work for racial justice -- I will not keep any of the proceeds.

### Here's how it works.
When you fill out the form (see the Purchase tab), you'll indicate which photo you want, and which organization you'd like to support. A  portion of each purchase will go towards covering the cost of printing and shipping, and the rest will be donated to the organization you choose. If you would prefer to donate to an organization not listed here, please indicate so on the form. For now, I am limiting this to organizations which are committed to racial equality.

### Supported Organizations
  1. **The Equal Justice Initiative** (National) - EJI is a national organization which provides legal aid and advocates for criminal justice reform.
  2. **Black Lives Matter (National)** - Black Lives Matter uses digital media and community organizing to eradicate white supremacy, intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities, and elevate Black voices.
  3. **Black Future Lab** (National) - Black Futures Lab uses community organizing to increase civic participation in Black communities and advocate for more racially equitable policy.
  4. **The Bail Project** - Bail Fund (national) - The Bail Project provides bail for low-income individuals who cannot afford it and advocates for a future without money bail.
  5. **Black Organizing Project** (Oakland) - The Black Organizing Project is a Black member-led community organization working for racial, social, and economic justice through grassroots organizing and community-building.
